## For Doxygen 
If you downloaded the source distribution, you need at least the following to build the executable:

1. The GNU tools flex, bison, libiconv and GNU make
2. You need python (version 2.7 or higher, see https://www.python.org).
3. In order to generate a Makefile for your platform, you need cmake version 3.3 or later.
